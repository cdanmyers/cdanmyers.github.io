I study how Americans think about, discuss, and participate in (or don't) politics. My research lies in the areas of Political Psychology and Political Communication. I have published research about deliberative democracy, partisanship and stereotypes, and the decline of local media. I teach classes about American political behavior and quantitative methodology. 

In addition to the Department of Political Science, I am core faculty at the Center for the Study of Political Psychology. Before coming to the University of Minnesota, I earned my Ph.D. in Politics at Princeton University and completed post-doctoral work at the University of Michigan.
