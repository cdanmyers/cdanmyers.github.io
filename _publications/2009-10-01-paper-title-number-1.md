permalink: /publication/Learning_from_Others
excerpt: 'How do political actors learn from the policies and outcomes of others when the connection between policy and outcomes is uncertain? In this paper, we develop and test a model of learning in an environment where the uncertainty in the connection between policy and outcomes is characterized by Browninan motion, limiting what actors can learn from othersâ€™ actions and outcomes.'
